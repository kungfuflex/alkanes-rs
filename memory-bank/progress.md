# ALKANES-RS Progress

## What Works

Based on the project structure and documentation, the following components appear to be implemented and functional:

### Core Infrastructure

1. **Indexer Implementation**: The main indexer for processing Bitcoin blocks and transactions is implemented.
2. **WebAssembly VM**: The virtual machine for executing smart contracts is functional.
3. **Message System**: The system for inter-contract communication is in place.
4. **Storage System**: The persistent storage for contract state is implemented.
5. **Network Configuration**: Support for multiple Bitcoin-based networks is available.

### Standard Library Contracts

Several standard contracts have been implemented:

1. **Auth Token**: Authentication token implementation for access control.
2. **Genesis Alkane**: Genesis contract for different networks.
3. **Merkle Distributor**: Token distribution mechanism.
4. **Proxy**: Contract proxy functionality.
5. **Upgradeable**: Upgradeable contract implementation.
6. **Owned Token**: Token with ownership verification.

### View Functions

The system provides several view functions for querying the state:

1. **protorunes_by_address**: Returns all protorunes held by a specific address.
2. **runes_by_address**: Returns all runes held by a specific address.
3. **protorunes_by_outpoint**: Returns protorune balances for a specific outpoint.

### Testing Framework

The project includes a comprehensive testing framework:

1. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end tests using the compiled WASM.
2. **Unit Tests**: Native Rust tests for individual components.
3. **Test Fixtures**: Simulated blockchain environments for testing.
4. **Test Helpers**: Utilities for creating test scenarios.

## What's Left to Build

Based on the project documentation and structure, the following areas may need further development:

### Standard Library Expansion

1. **Additional DeFi Primitives**: More financial instruments and protocols could be implemented.
2. **Cross-Chain Bridges**: Functionality for interoperability with other blockchains.
3. **Advanced Governance**: More sophisticated governance mechanisms.

### Tooling and Developer Experience

1. **Developer SDK**: A comprehensive SDK for building applications on ALKANES.
2. **Contract Templates**: More templates for common use cases.
3. **Documentation**: More extensive documentation and examples.
4. **Testing Tools**: More sophisticated testing tools for contract developers.

### Performance and Scalability

1. **Optimization**: Further optimization of the indexer and VM for better performance.
2. **Scaling Solutions**: Approaches to handle increased transaction volume.
3. **State Pruning**: Mechanisms to manage state growth over time.

### User Interface and Integration

1. **Web Interface**: A web-based interface for interacting with ALKANES contracts.
2. **Wallet Integration**: Integration with popular Bitcoin wallets.
3. **Block Explorer**: A specialized block explorer for ALKANES transactions.

## Current Status

The project appears to have a solid foundation with core functionality implemented. The indexer, VM, and standard library contracts are in place, providing the essential infrastructure for DeFi on Bitcoin.

The system supports multiple Bitcoin-based networks and includes a comprehensive testing framework. The standard library contracts provide the building blocks for common DeFi use cases.

## Known Issues

Based on the documentation, some potential issues to be aware of:

1. **Double Indexing**: Double indexing (calling `index_block` multiple times for the same block) can lead to inconsistent state and confusing test results.

2. **Table Dependencies**: View functions depend on specific tables being populated correctly. If these tables are not populated, the view functions may return unexpected results.

3. **Cross-Network Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent behavior across different Bitcoin-based networks may present challenges due to differences in address formats, block structures, and other parameters.

4. **Performance with Large State**: As the state grows, performance may degrade. Strategies for managing state growth may be needed.

5. **WebAssembly Limitations**: Smart contracts must operate within WebAssembly constraints, which may limit certain types of functionality.

## Next Milestones

Potential next milestones for the project could include:

1. **Community Adoption**: Increasing adoption among developers and users.
2. **Expanded DeFi Ecosystem**: Building more sophisticated DeFi applications on ALKANES.
3. **Integration with Other Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions**: Enhancing interoperability with other Bitcoin scaling solutions.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Improving execution efficiency and state management.
5. **Enhanced Developer Tools**: Building better tools for contract development and testing.
