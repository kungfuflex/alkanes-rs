# ALKANES-RS Progress

## What Works

Based on the existing codebase and documentation, the following components appear to be functional:

1. **Core Protocol Implementation**:
   - Block processing and indexing through the METASHREW stack
   - Message extraction and validation for ALKANES protocol messages
   - WebAssembly-based smart contract execution with fuel metering
   - Storage and state management for contract data

2. **Standard Library Contracts**:
   - Authentication token (alkanes-std-auth-token): Provides access control mechanisms
   - Genesis contracts (alkanes-std-genesis-alkane): Network-specific initialization
   - Owned token (alkanes-std-owned-token): Token implementation with ownership verification
   - Proxy contract (alkanes-std-proxy): Contract delegation and upgradeability
   - Upgradeable contract (alkanes-std-upgradeable): Support for contract upgrades
   - Merkle distributor (alkanes-std-merkle-distributor): Token distribution mechanism
   - Orbital functionality (alkanes-std-orbital): Additional protocol features

3. **View Functions**:
   - protorunes_by_address: Returns all protorunes held by a specific address
   - runes_by_address: Returns all runes held by a specific address
   - protorunes_by_outpoint: Returns protorune balances for a specific outpoint

4. **Multi-Network Support**:
   - Bitcoin mainnet, testnet, and regtest
   - Dogecoin
   - Luckycoin
   - Bellscoin
   - Fractal

5. **Development Tools**:
   - Build system for compiling contracts to WebAssembly
   - Testing framework for unit and integration tests
   - Protocol buffer code generation for message serialization

## What's Left to Build

Based on the project structure and documentation, the following components may still need development or enhancement:

1. **Advanced DeFi Primitives**:
   - Lending and borrowing protocols
   - Staking and yield farming mechanisms
   - Derivatives and synthetic assets
   - Governance mechanisms
   - Cross-chain bridges or interoperability

2. **Developer Experience**:
   - Comprehensive documentation and examples
   - CLI tools for contract deployment and interaction
   - Client libraries for different languages
   - Development environments and templates
   - Visual tools for contract design and testing

3. **ABI enhancements**:
I now want to add another attribute to define the return type of each function. The return type is specifically what gets put in the .data of the CallResponse. 
For example, in crates/alkanes-std-owned-token/src/lib.rs, get_name would have the return type of string

## Current Status

The project appears to have a solid foundation with the core protocol implementation and several standard library contracts in place. The system supports multiple networks and provides the basic infrastructure for DeFi applications on Bitcoin.

### Key Milestones Achieved:

1. **Core Protocol Implementation**: The foundational components of the ALKANES metaprotocol have been implemented.
2. **Standard Library Contracts**: Several standard contracts have been implemented for common use cases.
3. **Multi-Network Support**: The system supports multiple Bitcoin-based networks.
4. **View Functions**: Basic query functionality is in place for accessing protocol state.
5. **Development Tools**: Build system and testing framework are operational.

### In Progress:

1. **Advanced DeFi Primitives**: Development of more sophisticated financial instruments.
2. **Developer Experience**: Improving tools and documentation for developers.
3. **Performance Optimizations**: Enhancing system efficiency and scalability.
4. **Security Enhancements**: Strengthening the security posture of the system.
5. **Ecosystem Development**: Building a community and integrations with other projects.

## Known Issues

Based on the documentation, the following issues or challenges may exist:

1. **Table Consistency**: Double indexing (calling `index_block` multiple times for the same block) can lead to inconsistent state between tables, causing:
   - Additional tokens to be created with unexpected IDs
   - Balances to be swapped or duplicated
   - Inconsistent state between different tables

2. **View Function Dependencies**: View functions like `protorunes_by_address` depend on multiple tables being properly populated, which requires careful testing and validation.

3. **Cross-Network Compatibility**: Supporting multiple networks with different address formats, block structures, and activation heights requires careful handling of network-specific parameters.

4. **WebAssembly Limitations**: Smart contracts must operate within WebAssembly constraints, including limited memory model, no direct system access, and limited floating-point precision.

5. **Indexer Performance**: As the blockchain grows, the indexer must efficiently process increasing amounts of data while maintaining state consistency and providing responsive queries.

## Recently Fixed Issues

1. **Fuel Management**: Fixed multiple issues in the fuel management system:
   - **Fuel Refunding**: Fixed an issue where the fuel refunded to the block was the entire initially allocated amount rather than the actual remaining fuel leftover from running the transaction.
   - **Fuel Consumption**: Fixed an issue where WebAssembly execution was consuming all available fuel, leading to "ALKANES: revert: all fuel consumed by WebAssembly" errors.
   - **Diagnostic Logging**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the fuel management system to provide detailed information for debugging fuel-related issues.
   - **Fuel Benchmarking**: Implemented a benchmarking framework in the test suite to measure and analyze fuel consumption patterns.
   - **Fixed Fuel Costs**: Optimized fuel costs for large data operations by replacing variable costs with fixed costs.
   
   The fixes ensure:
   - Only the actual remaining fuel is refunded to the block
   - Proper fuel tracking during transaction execution
   - Explicit checks for fuel exhaustion with clearer error messages
   - Consistent error handling in fuel consumption
   - No incorrect fuel deductions in error cases
   - Detailed diagnostic information when fuel issues occur, including:
     - Transaction size and index
     - Initial and remaining fuel amounts
     - Block size and fuel allocation
     - Storage size and associated fuel costs
     - Step-by-step tracking of fuel allocation, consumption, and refunding
   - Comprehensive fuel benchmarking capabilities:
     - Tabular display of fuel consumption metrics
     - Per-operation fuel tracking
     - Percentage-based analysis of fuel usage
     - Aggregated statistics for total fuel consumption
   - Efficient handling of large data structures:
     - Block loading operations now use a fixed cost of 1000 fuel units regardless of block size
     - Transaction loading operations now use a fixed cost of 500 fuel units regardless of transaction size
     - Request operations use proportionally smaller fixed costs
     - Prevents excessive fuel consumption when working with large blocks (up to 4MB)
     - Real-world impact demonstrated in transaction logs:
       - Loading a 1.5MB block costs only 1,000 fuel units with fixed costs
       - Would have cost ~3,000,000 fuel units with previous per-byte charging
       - Represents a 99.97% reduction in fuel cost for this operation
   - Complete fuel usage visibility:
     - Added logging to all host functions that consume fuel
     - Each function logs its operation type, data sizes, and fuel cost
     - Contract calls log target information, input counts, and storage sizes
     - Special handling for deployment operations with additional fuel costs
     - Provides a comprehensive trace of all fuel consumption during execution
     - Analysis of real transaction logs reveals:
       - Context operations (request/load) are frequent but relatively inexpensive
       - Block operations benefit significantly from fixed costs
       - Most fuel consumption (~78M units in sample transaction) occurs in WebAssembly execution
       - Storage operations are minimal in comparison to execution costs
       - Detailed logs help identify specific operations consuming fuel
     - Transaction-level contract identification:
       - Added logging at the beginning of each transaction to identify the contract being called
       - Shows target contract address (block, tx), input count, and first opcode
       - Logs resolved contract addresses after address resolution
       - Provides enhanced error reporting with contract-specific context for fuel-related errors
       - Helps identify which specific contracts and operations are consuming excessive fuel

## Next Development Priorities

Based on the current status, the following priorities may be considered for the next development phase:

1. **Expand DeFi Capabilities**: Implement additional financial primitives to enable more sophisticated DeFi applications.

2. **Improve Developer Tooling**: Enhance the developer experience with better documentation, examples, and tools.

3. **Optimize Performance**: Address performance bottlenecks in state access, WASM execution, and indexing.
