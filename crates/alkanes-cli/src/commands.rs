//! # CLI Commands for `deezel`
//!
//! This module defines the `clap`-based command structure for the `deezel` CLI,
//! including subcommands for interacting with `bitcoind`. It also contains
//! the logic for pretty-printing complex JSON responses.

use clap::{Parser, Subcommand};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

// Chad's Journal:
//
// The `clap` crate automatically converts subcommand names to kebab-case by default
// (e.g., `GetBytecode` becomes `get-bytecode`). However, to maintain consistency
// with the `metashrew_view` RPC method, which is named `getbytecode`, we need to
// override this behavior.
//
// By adding `#[command(name = "getbytecode")]` to the `GetBytecode` variant,
// we ensure the CLI accepts `getbytecode` as the subcommand, aligning the
// developer experience with the underlying RPC method. This same approach is
// applied to other subcommands like `traceblock` and `getbalance` to keep
// the naming consistent across the board.
